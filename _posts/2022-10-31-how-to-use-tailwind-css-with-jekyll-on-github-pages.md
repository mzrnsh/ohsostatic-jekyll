This website is built with Jekyll, styled with Tailwind CSS, and hosted on
GitHub Pages. That combination doesn't quite work out of box. Tailwind CSS
requires PostCSS to compile and while Jekyll has a PostCSS plugin, it's not
currently [whitelisted](https://pages.github.com/versions/), meaning Tailwind
CSS won't be included in the default build produced by GitHub Pages. Let's fix
this via GitHub Actions.

CSS with Jekyll, look no further than this [brilliant article](https://mzrn.sh/2022/04/09/starting-a-blank-jekyll-site-with-tailwind-css-in-2022/){:target="_blank"}.
